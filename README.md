# simon-says-joystick-
In this project, using Arduino, I have created a simple Simon Says game with a joystick as the input.

The Coding Part:
Using a random number generator function, I light up one of four LEDs at a time. The input is taken through the joystick, and then I compare if the input matches or not. A green light is shown if it is correct, and a red light for incorrect. To reset the game, we use the switch on the joystick.

The Hardware:
A standard Arduino Uno (ATmega328P) is used, along with a knock-off PS2 joystick. For output, four LEDs represent the direction in which the joystick has to point, and two other LEDs are usedâ€”one for correct input and another for incorrect input. I will try to upload a picture of the connections.

Problems/Drawbacks:
At the moment, I can only take one input, and I have to be very fast. I don't know how to stop the loop until I give the input.
